    Distance amplitude panning

  <!--DESCRIPTION-->
  <description>
    DBAP is a amplitude based spatialisation technique that can be used with
    irregular loudspeakers configuation. It does not assume the loudspeakers to
    be in a regular array or circle surrounding the listener, and neither is it
    optimized for a particular listening position (sweet spot).

        The relative roll-off of amplitude with increasing distance from a
        destination point. The higher the roll-off value, the more sources will
        tend to be attracted towards the closest destination(s). High values can
        be used for synthetic spatialisation effects where sources are attracted
        to one destination at a time, with non-discontinuous transitions from
        one destination to the next.

    <method name='blur'>
      <digest>
        The spatial blurriness of each source can be controlled by the message
        <m>blur</m> with two arguments: the source instance number (integer),
        starting at 1, and the blur factor to use (decimal). The blur factor is
        related to the size of the space spanned by the destination points, with
        the intent that it is supposed to perceptually work similarly when moved
        from one layout to another. &lt;br/&gt; When the distance from source to
        destination is calculated as part of the DBAP algorithm, a radius <i>r</i> is
        introduced as an extra dimension in the calculation: distance =
        sqrt(Δx*Δx+Δy*Δy+r*r) where r = blur*v &lt;br/&gt; v is the variance
        of mean distance from destination points to the the mean position of the
        destination space. The larger the blurriness is, the more evenly the
        signal is distributed to all positions, resulting in a more diffuse
        localization.
